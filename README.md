# Node-Scripts

XenoPanel generates these files by default when you install a remote machine using the script provided on our website. 

These scripts allow servers to be created, configured & deployed and are open source to allow panel users to change the scripts to what they need. 

It is recommended you take backups of your scripts if you change them as once you use the "Sync Node Scripts" feature on the panel it will remove and re-create the files based on the updated versions direct from the XenoPanel CDN.
